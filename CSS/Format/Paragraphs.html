<h1>This Page is about Formatting the text</h1>
<h2>This section is about paragraphs and headlines</h2>
<p> This paragraph has &lt;em&gt; <em>emphasized text</em> for extra effect</p>
<article>
    <h1>This is headline1 Often used as main title</h1>
    <h2>This is headline2 Often used as explanatory sub title</h2>
    <h3>This is headline3 Often used for sub categories</h3>
    <h4>This is headline4</h4>
    <h5>This is headline5</h5>
    <h6>This is headline6</h6>
    <p>This a paragraph for reference. Every paragraph must be separated by &lt;p&gt; element.</p>
    <p>Every headline is separated by &lt;hNUMBER&gt; element</p>
    <h1>This is <em>Emphasized headline</em></h1>

    <p>This is a second article about bold and italics</p>
    <p>In HTML we need to differentiate between <em>emphasized</em> text and italics. &lt;<i>i</i>&gt; element is used for italics and &lt;em&gt; is used for emphesizing and significance.
        Reason for this is for further stylisation on CSS. 
    </p>
    <p>Another way to highlight text is to use &lt;<strong>strong</strong>&gt; element and &lt;<b>b</b>&gt; element. Use strong element to show importance and seriousness.
    Again the reason for this is to help stylisation on CSS</p>
